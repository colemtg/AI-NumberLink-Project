TODO: Define the representation of a state of the puzzle
- How to represent the variables: (current location, goal)?
TODO: Read in a file or input of a puzzle and convert to an initial state
TODO: Validate that an initial state is valid
TODO: Validate that a solution state is a solution to an initial state
TODO: Get next state function that gets all possible next states given a state
TODO: Function that calculates the g(s) of a current state, or incorporate into the state
TODO: Figure out what we want to use as our heuristic
- Some combination of Manhattan distance and amount of next states a variables has?
TODO: Implement greedy best first search
TODO: Implement A* search
TODO: Generate random puzzles
TODO: Run tests on the random puzzles
TODO: Implement improvements and run more tests
